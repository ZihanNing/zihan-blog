## Research Experience

- **General Inline Parallel Reconstruction/Post-processing Framework [open-sourced]**  
  **[Principle]** *Sep.2023 ‚Äì Sep.2025  üìç King‚Äôs College London & St. Thomas Hospital, UK* 
  - Proposed a practical framework for translating offline MR reconstructions to inline deployment, built on the Gadgetron platform ([Project open-sourced](https://github.com/ZihanNing/Practical_Inline_Recon_Framework-public.git) with [detailed instructions](https://github.com/ZihanNing/Practical_Inline_Recon_Framework-public/wiki), and [demo datasets for testing](https://zenodo.org/records/15839027))
  - Tested on [TwinsUK Project](https://twinsuk.ac.uk/) (>800 cases for now) for robustness validation   

  Related publications: [[ISMRM 2025 abstract](/files/Gadgetron_ISMRM2025.pdf)]; [Paper under review] 

- **Head Motion Correction (Inline) Reconstruction [open-sourced]**                   
  **[Principle]** *Sep.2023 ‚Äì Present  üìç King‚Äôs College London & St. Thomas Hospital, UK* 
  - Implemented AlignedSENSE with DISORDER trajectory to several clinical sequences (MPRAGE, MP2RAGE, FLAIR, SWI, etc) to achieve inline head motion correction reconstruction. 
  - Reconstruction [open-sourced](https://github.com/ZihanNing/Practical_Inline_Recon_Framework-public/tree/main/AlignSENSE_Recon_Demo), and validated to adults & neonates.
